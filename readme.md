As I worked through this assigment I was able to get more familar with Javascript DOM and get to know the syntax of Javascript in general. I got more familiar with how tables worked in javascript, and the logic of sorting algorithms. It felt lost at times but a just doing a bunch of searches on google helped a lot with the gaps in my knowledge.
