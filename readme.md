I tried my best to implement the function to sort. I sort of got it working but didn't know how i could compare objects with the same number so tried to do it a different way, but I can't figure out why it's not sorting now. Now it just doesn't work and I don't know how to solve it I tried different things but I feel like I lack javascript knowledge. Can't figure out how to sort the array of objects I have.
